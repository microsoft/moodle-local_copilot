# Copilot Plugin and Agent Samples for Moodle

## Overview

This repository contains Moodle plugin and agent samples for Education to be used with [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot) and Microsoft 365 [Copilot Chat](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/try-copilot-chat). These agents are provided as [M365 Copilot extensibility](https://aka.ms/extend-copilot) and therefore should be used with its existing customer-facing documentation.

The M365 Copilot plugin (local_copilot) enables Moodle to integrate with M365 Copilot and Copilot Chat by providing declarative agents for teachers and students. This integration allows users to access and interact with Moodle data directly through Copilot across multiple M365 apps, enhancing productivity and providing quick access to course information, assignments, and other educational resources.

The samples demonstrate how customers can create or customize their own declarative agents for M365 Copilot that connect to the Moodle LMS. Creation, customization, deployment, administration, support, and maintenance of any declarative agent for M365 Copilot based on these samples is at the discretion of the customer, and the responsibility of the customer.

## Features

The plugin provides samples for two separate declarative agents:

### Moodle Teacher
Allows teachers to:
- List courses they're teaching
- View course content and structure
- Find activities of a certain type
- View assignments and student submissions
- Create new assignments
- Update course images
- Monitor student progress and grades
- Create a new announcement (news forum discussion)

### Moodle Student
Allows students to:
- List enrolled courses
- View course content and activities
- Find activities of a certain type
- Find activity completion and grade information
- View assignment details, including due dates and submission status
- Check grades
- Find courses available for self-enrollment
- Self-enroll in courses

The features provided by the declarative agents may be extended in future releases.

![OAuth2 server configuration](/pix/screenshot_oauth2_server_configuration.png)

2. Click **Add OAuth client** button to create OAuth client for teacher. Following instructions on the page:
    - **Client ID** needs to be a string without space
    - **Redirect URI**: use `https://teams.microsoft.com/api/platform/v1.0/oAuthRedirect`
    - **Scope**: Use default value provided
    - After saving the changes, a **Client secret** will be generated for the OAuth client

![Add OAuth client](/pix/screenshot_add_oauth_client.png)

3. Do the same to create an OAuth client for student
4. There should be 2 clients for teacher and student separately after these steps

![OAuth clients list](/pix/screenshot_oauth2_client_list.png)

### 2. Register OAuth Client on Microsoft Teams Developer Portal

1. Go to [Microsoft Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com), login as a Teams admin user when asked
2. In the **Tools** menu, go to **OAuth client registration**

![Teams developer portal](/pix/screenshot_teams_developer_portal.png)

3. Click **New OAuth client registration** button or **Register client** button. You will need to create two OAuth client registrations, for teacher and student agents respectively
4. Fill in OAuth client details on the page:
    - **Registration name**: a name of your choice
    - **Base URL**: URL of the Moodle site
    - **Restrict usage by org**: My organization only
    - **Restrict usage by app**: Choose "Any Teams app" option for now

  ## Known limitations
  
- Limited to M365 apps that support declarative agents
- Limited to English (EN-US)
- Limited to return only 10 items from endpoint, plans to add pagination in the future
- Limited to return only info about the authenticated user, not bringing anything from any other user. For example, this first version won’t give teachers visibility on student information
- Only `image generator` and `code interpreter` capabilities have been enabled in this sample. Other knowledge sources need to be configured.
- OpenAPI limitations for API plugins [listed here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/known-issues#some-openapi-features-arent-supported)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Web Services Not Enabled**: Use the "Check required settings" button to enable necessary services
- **OAuth Configuration Issues**: Verify client IDs and secrets match between Moodle and Teams developer portal
- **Manifest Generation Errors**: Ensure all required fields are completed and icons are the correct size
- **Permission Errors**: Check that appropriate roles and capabilities are assigned in Moodle

- Check the [plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/moodle-local_copilot)

## Technical Details

The plugin implements a RESTful API with endpoints for both teacher and student interactions. These endpoints are exposed through declarative agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, allowing for secure and contextualized access to Moodle data. Key components include:

- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow between Moodle and Microsoft 365
- Declarative agent manifests with specialized instructions
- RESTful web service endpoints for data access and manipulation
- Adaptive Card templates for rich content display in Microsoft 365 Copilot

## Dependencies
- [Oauth2 Server](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_oauth2) plugin installed and configured. The plugin allows Moodle to act as an OAuth 2.0 provider, enabling secure authentication for the Copilot integration. The plugin is under GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3).
- [RESTful protocol](https://moodle.org/plugins/webservice_restful) plugin installed and enabled. The plugin adds restful web service support to Moodle, allowing external applications to interact with Moodle data using standard HTTP methods. The plugin is under GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3).

## Data Privacy and Security

- The plugin follows Moodle's privacy API requirements and does not store personal data beyond standard Moodle operations. It utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and respects Moodle's role-based permission system to ensure that users can only access data they have permissions for.
- This agent can access and retrieve Moodle data about
    - Courses
    - Sections
    - Assignments
    - Forums
- This agent requires user authentication and respects user permissions in Moodle
- The agent uses Moodle information as an input to Copilot across M365 apps

## Evaluation

- All response generation features of this agent were tested, measured, and validated internally
- [How declarative agents are evaluated?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/transparency-faq-declarative-agent#how-were-declarative-agents-evaluated-what-metrics-are-used-to-measure-performance)
- It's important to keep in mind that the output this agent provides can be inaccurate, incorrect, or out of date
