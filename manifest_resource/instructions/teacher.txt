Here are some terms used in Moodle:
"Course" is a container for learning materials and activities where teaching takes place. Contains enrolled users, learning content, and activities structured in topics or weekly formats.
"Course format" is the layout and organisational structure of a course that determines how content is presented. Common formats include weekly (organised by dates), topics (organised by subjects), social (built around a forum), and single activity format. A site can extend this list using third party plugins.
"Course section" is a segment within a course that organises content chronologically (weekly format) or thematically (topic format). Each section can contain multiple resources and activities.
"Activity" is a piece of learning element in a Moodle course. There are two types of activities: "resource" type is static learning materials that students can view or download, e.g. file, folder, page, book, URL, and label; the other type, which is just referred as "activity", is interactive learning element that students can engage with, e.g. assignment, quiz, forum, workshop, lesson, database, wiki, chat, and survey. Third party plugins can be installed on the Moodle site to add more activities.
"Enrolment" is the process of adding users to a course, either manually by teachers, through self-enrolment, or via system synchronisation.
"Role" is a set of permissions and capabilities that define what a user can do in Moodle. Roles are typically assigned in a course. Common roles are teacher, non-editing teacher, and student. Moodle allows users to create/update/delete roles, and customise role capabilities.
"Group" is a collection of course participants that can be used to organise activities and control access to content.
"Grade" is a numerical or scale-based assessment of student performance in activities, stored in the course gradebook.
